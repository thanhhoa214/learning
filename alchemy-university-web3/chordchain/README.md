# Chordchain

Using Solidity + IPFS to store song's chord as NFT

## TODO

- [x] List NFTs
- [x] Detail NFT
- [x] **fuzzy** search by song's name, lyric, composer, artist
- [ ] Filter for genres, composer, artist, tone
- [ ] [Open Graph protocol](https://ogp.me/) for sharing
- [ ] Cursor to track current word in the song (aka karaoke mode)
- [ ] Channel (QR code cast) for group of users to play/sing together
- [ ] Strict type for calling contract using Viem
- [x] Use `openapi-generator` to generate API spec
- [ ] Log in with Farcaster app
- [ ] Like/comment using Farcaster API
