# Angular Figma Generator

This plugin, I was working on Figma Plugin to generate code based on design system. From the idea that it is feasible to generate well maintenance codes for FE repository (Angular) by applying Figma Component and Figma AutoLayout features completely. It will save us a bunch of hours to back & forth to fix things like spacing or styling.

## Highlight:

- All elements inside an artboard are processable means we can generate code for web (Angular) and mobile (Flutter) as well.
- Extract all components being used in the page (imports list)
- Extract i18n from the page to json and name the key apply back to generated code
