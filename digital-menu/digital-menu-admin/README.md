## Development server

- Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Notes:
- Create a new branch for each ticket.
- We code only the UI first by **Bootstrap 4** (touch HTML & SCSS).

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

Run `npm run build:prod` to build the project in **production mode**. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
